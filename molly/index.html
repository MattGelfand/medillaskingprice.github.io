										Cars packed to capacity line up single-file on a poorly paved county road in rural Illinois. Volunteers shiver in the crisp fall air as they check ID’s and distribute 21+ wristbands through passenger-side windows. Blue, red and green lasers emanate from a gymnasium-sized structure and pierce the darkness, revealing the stumps of corn stalks beyond the distant fence.  Artificial smoke pours from the barn doors and clouds the entrance to the rave.
										</p>	
										<p>An eager young man pulls an oversized costume mouse head out of the trunk of his rust-covered four-door and tests the flashing LED’s inside the bulbous eyes before heading inside.  He joins several young women who pull leather jackets tighter to their corset-clad torsos and scurry across the wet grass toward the warmth of the barn, their legs protected by their fishnets and spandex shorts.  They enter to the pulse of bass bumping with electronic snares and high-hat noises in hissing frequencies.  Looped melodies rise to crescendos, bringing an extra dose of energy to the crowd massed in front of the 7-foot speakers.  Smiling faces and twisting bodies flash in and out of view as the lights swirl in time to the chest-penetrating sounds of the latest DJ to take the stage.
										</p>
										<p>At this one-night-only mecca of Electronic Dance Music, the line between costume and style is drawn faintly.  Wide leg pants with nylon webbing straps flap on the legs of one skinny goateed man while he moves in choreographed patterns.  On his back he wears a fuzzy spiked turtle shell, half Pokémon, half Mario Kart. Two teenage girls sport matching fuzzy, rainbow boots, tulle tutus and black t-shirts with neon lettering: “Molly is my Homegirl.”

								Molly has made a lot of friends in the past few years, and not just at raves like these.  Dealers tout Molly as white powder or crystals of pure MDMA (the same chemical that draws users to pressed tablets known as Ecstasy).  Users say Molly is not the pressed pill of assorted dicey chemicals, as many came to see Ecstasy after publicized club deaths in the 2000s, but a pure, safe and clean dose of MDMA.  MDMA is the drug that promises a few hours of empathetic euphoria and feelings of intense social connection, where electronic music and the requisite light show create a perfect moment of emotional, serotonin-fueled release.  As MDMA’s latest pseudonym, Molly has the further allure of popping up in pop and rap hits, and it has jumped from EDM club drug to party drug of the millennials.  But when some of these Molly-popping teenagers end up dead or in the emergency room, like at a recent festival in New York City, something’s gone wrong with Molly.
								</p>
								<p>	
								Molly’s identity is not that simple.  Ecstasy’s younger, cleaner cousin turns out to be anything but that.  MDMA is the same molecule that was once the center of decades of medical research as a psychotherapeutic medicine, and still has its devoted followers in the research field.  In controlled environments, these researchers claim MDMA can be relatively safe and psychologically beneficial.  So It’s probably not MDMA but what you’ll actually find in that little capsule that’s killing promising college students and leaving unsuspecting teens in the hospital.  Demand is up, and, like any other product, people are out there looking to profit.  This means knockoffs and filler, and in Molly’s case the filler could kill you.  It’s Molly’s moment, and it may not pass until this innocent girl’s name is exposed for the marketing term it’s come to be.

								Merck, the German pharmaceutical company, first developed MDMA as a chemical compound in 1912 with the intent of creating a new blood clotting agent.  Researchers stumbled upon something entirely different instead, so they patented the drug and set it aside.  It probably wasn’t until MDMA’s psychological effects were discovered and tested during the Cold War that the drug was taken by humans.  The study of its medicinal value has spanned decades and transcended prohibition.  “It was used from the middle ‘70s to the early ‘80s in a therapeutic context under the code name Adam,” says Rick Doblin, longtime researcher of MDMA and founder of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies in Santa Cruz, Cal.
								</p>
								<p>
								Prior to becoming a schedule one substance in 1985 (the highest risk level, defined by the Department of Justice as having “no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse”), there was a mountain of research piling up regarding MDMA’s healing qualities.  Doblin says ‘Adam’ was used in about a half million doses medicinally during the decade before its prohibition.  Some of the patients sought to profit on their prescriptions by selling it in recreational settings, primarily nightclubs. “So when the DEA moved in 1984 to criminalize MDMA, they had only heard about it as Ecstasy, they had never heard about it as Adam and they had no idea that was used for so long for therapy purposes,” says Doblin.

										The laws of supply and demand are especially harsh in an unregulated black market.  MDMA’s prohibition in the U.S. forced the marketplace underground, where the pharmaceutical-quality Adam gave way to the mysterious Ecstasy.  Whether the pills were locally made or imported from Europe, users were less and less sure of what they were taking.  As demand for MDMA rose, dealers laced the drug until it no longer resembled its former self and maybe didn’t even include MDMA at all.
										</p>
										<p>
										In the same way Ecstasy began getting a bad rap once it started being cut, so too has Molly. While pop stars, famous athletes and ravers tout Molly as a regression to the purity of Adam, a substance with the safety and regulation of a pharmaceutical, it’s not.
										</p>
										<p>	
										“If I hear one more person say that ‘Molly’ means a pure form of MDMA… It just makes me want to scream.  It is absolutely not that,” says Carissa of DanceSafe, an organization that promotes harm-reduction efforts at concerts, festivals and raves. “It definitely can be whatever anybody wants to put in a capsule, and a white powder could be any number of things.”

						<p>During the first hour after ingesting Molly, the user is brimming with anticipation, waiting for Molly’s effects to flood over his body.  Once Molly enters the users bloodstream, they begin to feel its effects pulsating through their body.  Tingling their senses.  An overwhelming sense of euphoria will overwhelm him for the next few hours.
						</p>
						<p>
						Greg, 23, from California said that feeling crept up his lower back and moved across his body in waves.  “And then your vision starts getting a little blurry and messed up, like you can't read small print and or anything like that.  You start to forget what you're talking about mid-sentence.  And you definitely start getting a good body feeling like feelings of euphoria,” he says.   
						</p>
						<p>	
						The first time Richard, 23, from California used Molly he was in his junior year of high school at a party.  “I heard it was fun and other people were doing it so I was going to be the cool kid and I guess just try it,” says Richard.  He recalls feeling as if his head was vibrating and a feeling of pure happiness.  “I remember when I took it I felt like someone was massaging my head, but no one was touching me,” says Richard.
						</p>
						<p>	
						The effects of Molly typically last from four to six hours, but the hangover itself has a delayed response.  Josh said the first couple of times he used Molly the days after were not excruciating.
						</p>
						<p>		
						“You start gradually turning back to reality.  All of a sudden light itself doesn’t look like a solid object.  It just looks like a F****** light,” says Josh.  “The first couple times you take it and you wake up the next day and feel great.  It’s called an afterglow.  For some reason you just feel wonderful the next day.  The second day after you’ve taken it you don’t feel so great.  It’s like that’s when the hangover happens.  Imagine getting trashed from alcohol thinking, ‘I’ll be great tomorrow, but the next day I’ll be puking in a toilet.’  That’s how it was.”
						</p>
						<p>	
						For Josh, the more often he used Molly, the less interesting the experience was and the worse the hangover.  
						</p>
						<p>
						“It’s more dull.  It’s more cloned.  It’s less interesting.  Then the second day the afterglow completely disappears and a miniature hangover happens.  Then the second day the real, real hangover starts to magnify slowly.  Then it starts to go on for longer.  You don’t recover immediately.  It takes more than three days to recover from it.  It starts going to four, five, six.  And then it turns into where you take it and you know the next week is going to suck,” he said. “It just became unpleasant.”
						</p>
						<p>	
						MDMA impacts the user’s nervous and cardiovascular systems.  MDMA targets the brain’s three main neurotransmitter systems; dopamine, which is a chemical released by nerve cells which sends signals to other nerve cells, serotonin, which is most commonly associated with the feeling of happiness or well being but can also control appetite, sleep, memory, temperature regulation and cardiovascular function, and norepinephrine, which affects the heart rate.
						</p>
						<p>	
						According to Michael J. Kuhar, Ph.D., Yerkes National Primate Research Center of Emory University and Candler Professor of Neuropharmacology, School of Medicine, MDMA is “an amphetamine derivative.  Its main effect is to “inhibit the uptake of serotonin and promote its release,” he says.
						</p>
						<p>
						On a more biological front, high doses of MDMA can cause high blood pressure and irregular heart function, and in extreme cases serious mental clouding, seizures and perhaps death, Kuhar says.
						</p>
						<p>	
						Once MDMA is ingested, serotonin containing nerve terminals start putting out large amounts of excess serotonin.  Meanwhile both norepinephrine and dopamine are also released.  “The release of these chemical messages, or neurotransmitters, creates a whole array of symptoms, which are attributable to the activity of these chemicals on their target sites,” says Bertha K. Madras, Ph.D. from Harvard’s department of Psychiatry.
						</p>
						<p>	
						Other effects related to the drug can be increased body temperature, higher energy and activity (which can be a factor to the high body temperature) and sleep problems.
						</p>
						<p>	
						Alongside Molly’s growth and corruption have been talks about its addictive traits.  Many disagree on its addictive properties. Users believe it’s not addicting, while Madras thinks the drug can be addictive, and that younger users are more at risk because they have not had negative experiences with the drug in the past.  
						</p>
						<p>	
						“In other words, they’re not sitting in a hospital emergency department, which can happen.  They haven’t had an acute cardiovascular event,” she says.  “They haven’t suffered hyponatremia, you know, so their kidneys shut down.  They haven’t had an acute hyperthermia where their body temperature has risen over 105.  For many of these folks that have had the experience without these negative effects, there’s a perception that the drug is safe, but the science tells us quite differently.”
						</p>
						<p>	
						For Kuhar, he has not seen enough research on the subject to make a definite judgment on its addictive properties.  “For a substance to be considered addicting the hallmark has to be that you seek the drug in spite of negative consequences in your life and personal distress,” said Kuhar. 
						</p>
						<p>	
						“Now as far as I know there are not a lot of controlled studies showing there is a lot of addiction in humans, although I think it’s definitely a possibility.  Animal studies suggest that animals will self-administer the drug; they will seek out MDMA.  But it seems that animals may seek out MDMA less than they do other substances like cocaine.  That is not to say the dangers of the drug are any less overall than the dangers of something that’s more addicting like opium or cocaine, because the dangers are significant.” Kuhar says.

										A couple enters the tent, zipping themselves in. She’s wearing lavender bell-bottom sweatpants and thick-rimmed glasses, he’s ready to dance in his tent-legged kick pants. They got the blue pressed pills in Arkansas at a festival, she says. “I just want to know what it is,” she explains, “I know it’s not the real deal because it made me see stars, like in my peripheral vision, you know?” 
										</p>
										<p>
										“It looks like it’s probably a cathinone.” 
										</p>
										<p>
										“That’s sort of what I thought,” she says. 
										</p>
										<p>
										“Now that you know what it is, would you still take it?”
										</p>
										<p>
										The man scoffs, “No.”
										</p>
										<p>	
										“Here, try this one,” he says, pulling a plastic sandwich bag with about 200 clear capsules out of his enormous pockets, and some gram-weight bags.  
										</p>
										<p>	
										A bit of liquid falls from the end of the dropper and envelops the trio of milky crystal granules as it splashes across the bottom of the plastic dish.  Immediately, bubbles erupt from the surface, fizzing as the mixture pops from colorless to a deep indigo.  In the next dish, another indicator liquid flashes to life.  This is the real thing.  Unlike the other tests that night, there’s no need to pick up the chart and squint at the color combinations that shed light on invisible chemistry.  The couple share a knowing glance. “Got that on the internet.”
										</p>
										<p>
										“The Road?”
										</p>
										<p>
										“Yeah,” he says. How much did you buy that for?
										</p>
										<p>
										“Our costs are probably two to four bucks a dose, and we sell it for 10, maybe 20,” she says.
										</p>
										<p>
										“I would say 80 percent of the things that I test that are ‘Molly’ are not MDMA,” Carissa says. In a single evening she sees everything from cathinones (otherwise known as bath salts), to DMT (a powerful hallucinogenic), to methamphetamine and a number of other substances.
										</p>
										<p>	
										Many young adults taking the drug aren’t ignorant of this fact, but they are in search of a clean, safe high. Silk Road, a website recently shut down by the FBI, sold drugs including Molly in a secret digital marketplace. Users could allegedly purchase any manner of illegal substances and have them mailed directly to their doorstep. Customers could also review products like you’d rate a purchase made on Amazon. 
										</p>
										<p>	
										“Silk Road was an attempt by the drug using community at self-regulation,” Doblin says. “People really want to know what they’re getting, they want a regulated market.”
										</p>
										<p>	
										With the closing of the site, Carissa fears that lacing of Molly will escalate even further. 
										</p>
										<p>	
										“The vendors [on Silk Road] are advertising what they have as what they have. They’re not misinforming, saying, ‘Hey I’ve got MDMA when it’s not MDMA,” she says, though she says she’s never personally been to the site.  “Anyone can take a white powder and put it in a capsule and sell it to you as ‘Molly,’ but if you’re buying something and you know it’s a cathinone right off the bat, at least you know.”

								In the darkness just out of reach of the outdoor floodlights, a short man intercepts ravers before they enter: “Hi, my name is Ivo, Ivo with the braids,” he says, sticking out his hand for a shake. “I’ve got that Molly, I’ve got that good kush.”  He goes on to announce the rest of his offerings, using more buzzwords that carry a lot of meaning but not much substance. His short cornrow braids rest on his sweatshirt hood and he clutches a half-filled, clear plastic cup in his other hand, a wave of liquor fumes accompany his greeting.  “If they sell it to you for $100, I’ll give it to you for…for $40.” As proof he can be trusted, he assures potential buyers he’s “part of the Grateful Dead family,” pulling up his sleeve to reveal a smudged tattoo that covers his upper arm.
								</p>
								<p>
								Later, Ivo will wander up again, clearly drunker, even friendlier.  Is Molly going by the gram?  No, he’s selling pressed pills.  Normally $20 a dose, but he’d go $30 for two. This time, he leans in closer, hot boozy breath punctuating every word.  “I’ve got that coke, too.”  Two serious men stand at a slight distance, clear-eyed, watching closely.  One wears a Chicago Bears hat and a gray jacket and jeans.  No neon, no glowing lights or fun masks like the crowd swirling around them.  Unsmiling, businesslike.  Ivo is just the bait; these are businessmen.
								</p>
								<p>
								Whether Molly is pure or not seems to have little bearing on sales, according to the Drug Enforcement Agency. “We’ve seen a slight increase in virtually every office,” says Special Agent in Charge of the Midwest, Jack Riley. “Some of the other larger cities, New York, Philadelphia, the Washington DC area have seen a significant spike over the past five years.”  
								</p>
								<p>
								Ivo is far from an isolated case - the peddling of a quick high at clubs and festivals has been linked since users’ parents jammed out at Woodstock.  “I almost felt it was encouraged.  That was the most awful thing in a way,” says Olivia Gordon, a former user who documented her experiences in her book The Agony of Ecstasy.  “It was sort of like you were expected to take drugs at the parties and raves.  Because my friends were into taking the drugs as well I never had to go out of my way to seek them out.”  Even with the appearance of heightened security, Richard, a graduate student and former Molly user who asked to be identified by his first name only, says Molly never had trouble getting to the show:  “You can hide it in so many different compartments, your shoes… and they want your money at the end of the day, you know?”
								</p>
								<p>	
								So Molly is tricky in more ways than one, the marketing of the drug promises purity and safety and the high backs it up—at least when the user is getting what they think they are, MDMA. The trouble is, as demand has gone up, purity has virtually ceased to exist and it’s often the lacing ingredients that are to blame for bad trips.
								</p>
								<p>
								Demand for the drug has increased so much that cartels are entering the scene, according to the DEA. In the past, small amounts of MDMA were being smuggled in from the club scene in parts of Europe where the drug is legal, but “much of what we’re seeing now originates in Asia,” says Riley. “Traditionally we’ve seen it from Amsterdam, the Netherlands, those areas. Recently we’re seeing quite a bit, bulk stuff coming from Asia.”
								</p>
								<p>	
								Safrole oil, the primary ingredient used to make MDMA, comes almost exclusively from ancient Selasian wood trees in the Cardamom Mountains of Cambodia. The trees are an endangered species as are many species of wildlife that reside in their shade. Harvesting these trees without permission is illegal. [MORE? RESEARCHING]
								</p>
								<p>
								The main ingredient of Molly is difficult to obtain in other countries and illegal in the United States as it’s classified as a List I chemical [LOOK UP MEANING]. The finished product is banned and the trade spans multiple continents. So it’s no wonder that by the time Molly finally finds its way into concerts, festivals, raves and parties here in the U.S. it’s laced with anything and everything to maximize profit.
								</p>
								<p>
								“Lets make it very clear, the people producing this are not in white coats and sterile labs,” Riley says.  “No, this is in the basement of some crooks house, stirring the bucket, pressing the pills out.  So, however cosmetically appealing the capsule may look, there’s no way to know.”

										What’s perhaps most tragic about the Molly conundrum is that these young adults aren’t trying to hurt anyone, including themselves, or ruin anyone’s good time.  Users are searching for something in these trips that isn’t provided in their day-to-day interactions. In the case of Greg, [TK AGE] an EDM enthusiast from Southern California who now chooses to abstain from drugs, MDMA was an attempt at self-medication.
										</p>
										<p>
										His traumatic memories from childhood were difficult to express and often made it hard for him to relate to others.  Taking Ecstasy, and later Molly, helped him feel close to others he says, to feel like one of the crowd. In junior and senior year of high school, "it brought me out of my shell and made it easier for me to connect with people," he says.

										Doblin hypothesizes that this is a common theme among recreational users—that they are taking it with the intention to escape past trauma or even simply to find human interaction without a screen. “For most of us, what life’s about is human relationships,” he says. “MDMA is about love, it’s about connection, it’s about listening, it’s about feeling. And it’s an antidote to this heavily electronic culture that we’re developing. People are hungry for being able to communicate and talk to people.”
										</p>
										<p>
										According to the National Drug Intelligence Center, a component of the United States Justice Department, more than 10 percent of high school seniors have tried MDMA at least once and more than 2 percent said they’ve used the drug in the last month as of April 2013. Even as far back as 1987, a Stanford University study showed that 39 percent of undergraduate students had taken MDMA at least once.  Greg says the calming, euphoric feeling that can break down even the toughest people makes Molly an ideal introduction to narcotics: “If you’re going to do drugs for the first time, I mean I’m not recommending anyone do drugs at all, but Molly would definitely be the safe one to go.”  
										</p>
										<p>
										Other users say seeing their friends rolling only strengthened their desire to join in.  “You know that through the eyes of a 17-year-old who just wants to have a great time and party – I was already smoking Marijuana and I’d already tried other drugs as well like LSD and Speed – it seemed like the kind of fun drug to take,” Gordon says.  She added that warnings from the older generation only fed the excitement: “There was a sort of cool about it just because the authorities say to young people, ‘This is dangerous.  Don’t do it.’  And it’s always been that way where young people go and do what they want to do anyway, whether it’s drugs or driving too fast or drinking or smoking or the things you’re not supposed to do.  So in that way I think it’s a rebellious culture.”
										</p>
										<p>
										Aside from the feelings of empathy and connection to others, Molly fans also report feeling “in control” of their high. Compared to the sloppiness resulting from alcohol or paranoia of hallucinogens, Molly users feel composed, even authoritative, while rolling.
										</p>
										<p>
										Josh, a former Molly and ecstasy user who estimates he rolled between 15 and 17 times over a six-year period, says: “The way I could talk to people was at this level that actually impressed me.  I just felt that whoever was talking to me I could make laugh and I had complete control over the conversation.  I felt like a benevolent dictator, is what I’m saying.  I felt great and I wanted everyone to be happy and on my side.”

								Many writers have drawn a connection between Molly and the explosion of electronic dance music in recent years. This at first appears a fair conclusion considering the DEA has noticed a spike in MDMA seizures between 2007 and when EDM began frequenting top 40 charts. Cascada entered the American Top 40 charts in 2008 with her electronic dance rendition of “What Hurts the Most.” EDM was prominent again in America Top 40 in 2009 with David Guetta and Akon’s song “Sexy Bitch.” EDM artist Avicii took the top spot for the week of Nov. 16, 2013, with “Wake Me Up.”  He was one of many EDM artists displayed in the chat.
								</p>
								<p>
								Molly’s fans agree that there’s just something about rolling (taking Molly or Ecstasy) that seems to compliment the genre. “I think the way the beat goes with the techno and with EDC [electronic daisy carnival] and the David Guettas of the world,” says Richard.  “I think the beat just sounds a lot better—the way your body moves and the way your mind feels it just intertwines with that.  It just feels good, it feels right, it just kind of goes together.  I don’t really know how to explain it to you but if you put on a rap song I probably wouldn’t feel the same.” 
								</p>
								<p>	
								Not everyone in the EDM scene approves of the supposed correlation often drawn between the music and Molly. After a bad batch of Molly likely caused two deaths at the Electric Zoo festival in New York, the second day of the event was canceled and the news rocked the EDM world.  Kaskade, a prominent DJ, took to Twitter expressing his anger that the media is demonizing his entire genre. The artist tweeted: “But we're being tasked with fixing problems that are global in scope + limitless in reach. Scapegoating at its most transparent.”
								</p>
								<p>
								Kaskade’s main point during his early-October rant was that while other entertainment industries have their own dirty habits (he chose to point out alcohol and sports), they aren’t being forced to cancel their concerts or events. So those not responsible for horrible tragedies like the Electric Zoo or the Electric Daisy Festival deaths, whether that’s fans who abstain or musicians themselves, are being punished by cancelled concerts and negative media attention.
								</p>
								<p>
								Tom Swoon, a rising Polish DJ recently named a 2013 ‘Artist to Watch’ by Billboard Magazine, is also frustrated by the propensity for one person’s misconduct to earn a bad rap for an entire $20 billion industry.
								</p>
								<p>
								“When you see this news about the drug-related things for example at the major festivals and stuff like that, its weird because it takes only one irresponsible person to make an image for a whole festival, for a whole community, for a whole genre, you know,” Swoon says.

										By the bonfire at the rural rave, people are friendly.  They offer cans of Keystone to strangers, gushing over costumes and relinquishing precious fireside space to one another on this cold November evening. One especially embellished young woman shivers and cautiously steps between bodies to get closer to the fire. Her blonde hair is separated into twin buns high atop her head and blue glitter on the outer corners of her eyes reflects the firelight. She’s wearing a multicolor, lace-up corset over a long sleeve black shirt; her short flouncy skirt bounces with her tiny, childlike frame as she tries to keep warm. Her outlandish attire garnishes countless compliments from her peers, which she accepts sweetly. Stretching her sleeves over her clenched fists, she clutches her forearms to her chest as she explains how she’s studying at a community college in a nearby town. She used to study pharmacology. She used to do drugs too she says but now, she shakes her head, gazing off in the distance, “they’re just too unpredictable.”  Backtracking, she starts to explain how she spent three years living in Europe and she never saw the addiction problems that she sees here, citing prescription ADHD medications in particular.  But no one is listening anymore except a stranger she doesn’t know and her date’s wandered away, uninterested. The cold air becomes a new safe topic and a fire breather appears on the other side of the bonfire, distracting anyone who was still paying attention.
										</p>

										Because of what Doblin calls our “prohibition culture” in the United States, harm reduction is often stifled. Organizations like DanceSafe aren’t always allowed into events because that would be implying that the venue knows there is drug use occurring and are, to a certain extent, permitting it.
										</p>
										<p>	
										By contrast in Europe, especially in countries where recreational drug use is legal, harm reduction entities like DanceSafe are not just allowed into concerts, they are required. Portugal’s Boom festival is similar to Burning Man in many regards except one: Drug use is permitted and public. They take harm reduction so seriously that dealers must bring their products to a central tent to be tested, and then the purity (or lack thereof) is broadcast to all concertgoers, creating a truly free marketplace. Users know what they’re taking, they know where it’s coming from and they know the risks before them.
										</p>
										<p>
										This open-mindedness isn’t possible yet in the United States but steps towards improving harm reduction are being made. This past summer DanceSafe was invited to TomorrowWorld, an EDM festival in rural Georgia. TomorrowWorld is run by European promoters and is the first international iteration of Tomorrowland, the world’s largest EDM festival, which originated in Belgium.
										</p>
										<p>	
										It’s unlikely the DEA would support this kind of free-market transparency.  “It would be crazy to legalize drugs,” Riley says, adding that dealers like Ivo will always look to profits first.  “They’re in it for the money, and they don’t care what happens.  So, the end user is the one that’s left holding the bag and at most risk,” Riley says.  “So these people are preying on people lives.  There is no difference between, in my opinion, between someone that’s selling Molly at a nightclub than a Gangster Disciple who’s selling heroin and has a pistol in his hand and just killed somebody.”
